Learning Verilog
================

This repository will contain some of the files that I will write as I learn the Verilog language.

For others' benefit, as well as that of my future self,
I shall describe some of the details of getting this code working.

Icarus Verilog
--------------

A Free and Open Source Verilog simulator.
Find the homepage [here](http://iverilog.icarus.com/page), 
and User Guide [here](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/User_Guide),
but most importantly, install from your package manager as "iverilog".

GTKWave
-------

A Free and Open Source waveform viewer.

Make
----

Everything is run with Makefiles.
In general, to compile everything and run all included testbenches, simply run "make".
